# From Auditing Firewalls to Defending Them

For the first part of my internship, I was the building inspector. I reviewed blueprints (policies), checked the structural integrity of systems, and even tested the emergency response plans by running a phishing simulation. My work was in the world of Governance, Risk, and Compliance, the strategic "why" behind security.

Now, it was time to wee the other side of the coin.

I transitioned from my role at the parent company, FJ Management, to a more direct, hands-on position as a **Cybersecurity Analyst** at one of its subsidiaries, **Big West Oil**. I was moving from planning and assessing to defending in real-time.

## A Familiar Map, A New Battlefield

What made this transition so unique was that I wasn't walking in blind. During my time as an auditor, one of my first projects involved reviewing the firewall rules and security posture of the very company I was now joining. I had already seen the blueprints.

As an auditor, my questions were strategic: Does this policy effectively reduce risk? Is it documented correctly? Is it essential for the business?

Now, as an analyst staring at an XDR (Extended Detection and Response) platform, I was watching the live traffic flowing through those same firewalls. My questions became immediate and tactical: Is that packet an attack?

## Connecting the "Why" to the "What"

This immediate connection between my two roles was a game-changer. When I saw an alert for suspicious traffic coming from a specific network segment, I didn't just see an IP address. I remembered the conversations from my audit about *why* that segment was configured the way it was and what critical business assets it housed.

This experience provided the context, the "why" that made the real-time data, the "what" more meaningful. I understood that the alerts weren't just random noise they were potential threats to the very systems whose defenses I had previously been tasked with inspecting.

This experience immediately began to bridge the gap between the two sides of the cybersecurity coin. The rules and policies I had been auditing were no longer abstract concepts. They were the digital barriers I was now responsible for defending on the front lines.

## What's Coming Next

But make no mistake, the transition wasn't seamless. Knowing the 'why' didn't automatically teach me the 'how.' Moving into an analyst role was like learning a new language, one filled with a new vocabulary of tools, queries, and investigative techniques.

Next week, Iâ€™ll take you inside my day-to-day as a "Digital Detective," sharing what it was like to grapple with that learning curve, investigate real alerts, and hunt for threats in a sea of data.
