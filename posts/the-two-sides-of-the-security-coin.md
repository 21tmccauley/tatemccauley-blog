# The Two Sides of the Cybersecurity Coin

If you ask the average person what they think about cybersecurity, they'll probably imagine a hacker in a hoodie, scrolling walls of green text right out of *The Matrix*, or a news story about a data breach. While these things might be part of cybersecurity, they only focus on one side of the coin.

Over the past eight months, I had the opportunity to see the other side of cybersecurity. Through two very different internships, I experienced two distinct perspectives on security: first as an Internal ITGC Auditor for FJ Management, and then as a Cybersecurity Analyst for Big West Oil. 

Over the next 10 weeks, I'm going to share experiences and lessons that I learned.

## Side A: The Building Inspector (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)

My journey began in the world of **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**. A good way to think of this role is like being a building inspector for a bustling city. The buildings are already standing and operational, and my job was to come in and ensure everything was up to code.

I wasn't designing from scratch; I was examining ongoing business and technical processesâ€”reviewing the 'structural integrity' of a firewall's rules, checking the 'fire exits' of a CI/CD pipeline, and ensuring the 'safety plans' (policies) were being followed in real-time. It's the critical work of finding hidden risks in active systems before they lead to a collapse.

**This is the "why" behind the rules.**

## Side B: The Firefighter (Security Operations)

Then, I flipped the coin and moved to the front lines as a **Cybersecurity Analyst**. If GRC is the building inspector, then Security Operations (SecOps) is the city's firefighter. They are the ones watching for the first sign of smoke, responding to alarms in real-time, and rushing to the scene of a crisis.

This is the world of XDR platforms, threat monitoring, and incident response. It's about asking "Is there a fire right now?" and "How do we put it out?" This is the tactical, reactive work that contains damage.

**This is the "how" of cybersecurity.**

## Why Seeing Both Sides Matters

So, why does seeing both matter? A building inspector who has never been to a fire doesn't fully grasp the real-world consequences of a failed inspection. A firefighter who doesn't understand the building's layout or its hidden safety flaws might struggle to respond effectively.

My time in auditing gave me a deep appreciation for why the rules existed for our ongoing processes, which made me far more effective when I was on the front lines, tasked with defending those same processes.

## What's Coming Next

I hope you'll follow along as I share specific stories and insights from these roles.

**Next week**, I'll dive into my first major project: auditing the security integration of a corporate merger.
